## Project Description
This project is an e-commerce platform designed to manage various business types, including pharmacies, supermarkets, and laundromats. It provides functionality to handle business-specific products, categories, and subcategories, along with brand management.

The platform features dynamic route handling, allowing each business type to have its own set of brands displayed under a unique URL, making it easier to manage and navigate the system. Users can also manage business types, categories, and brands through a user-friendly admin interface.

Currently, the project is a work in progress, and several features are still being developed. The overall architecture is designed to be scalable, modular, and flexible, catering to the evolving needs of different business types.
